This is a practical guide to threads in ROS, focused on python. 
There are two goals:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Suggest basic patterns to generally make your code safe in the face of the multiple threads that ROS implicitly creates in python</li>
<li>Explore threads in python and ROS through experimentation</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org979e518">What is a process?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org979e518">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A <a href="https://www.tldp.org/LDP/tlk/kernel/processes.html">process</a> is an abstraction used by
the Linux Kernel (and other operating systems) to segregate sequences of machine instructions into
their own memory address space and schedule their execution time.</li>
<li>The operating system constantly switches the code that the CPU is executing between the machine code in various processes,
to provide the illusion of simultaneous execution.  On multi-core CPU's a few processes can run simultaneously.
However, there are usually more processes than available CPU cores.</li>
<li>Each process thinks it has access to a full memory-address space: in reality the kernel is hiding the true physical addresses
and managing access to these physical addresses.  The addresses used by processes are referred to as <i>virtual</i> addresses</li>
<li>Because each process has its own view of memory, sharing data between processes requires the intervention
of the operating system.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="orgcef2706">What is a thread?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcef2706">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A <a href="https://www.tldp.org/FAQ/Threads-FAQ/Types.html">thread</a> is subordinate unit of execution within a process</li>
<li>Each process can have multiple threads each of which executes its respective machine code instructions simultaneously (as scheduled by the kernel)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every process has a "main" thread, which is the only code that executes when you
or the functions you call do not create additional threads</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A given process's threads all share the same memory address space as the parent process
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each thread has its own stack (for calling functions and storing local variables)</li>
<li>The heap and global variables are shared by threads</li>
<li>One thread can directly affect the memory used by another thread, without operating system intervention (in contrast to a process).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If two threads access the same memory and are not coordinated properly, a bug called a <i>race condition</i> can occur. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A race condition can result in data corruption</li>
<li>It can also result in a deadlock, where no thread can continue executing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The exact interleaving of the instructions across multiple threads is non-deterministic because it depends on how the kernel
schedules execution, which in turn depends on what else is happening on the computer
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Non-deterministic bugs in multi-threaded code may be from a race condition</li>
<li>Be cautious and have a plan before introducing extra threads into your program</li>
</ul></li>

<li>- As the operating system switches between threads, it is possible for instructions to be interrupted before completing:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Generally, a single python statement maps to multiple machine instructions and thus a statement can be interrupted in the middle of executing</li>
<li>Consider <code>i = i + 1</code>.  The thread can be interrupted in the middle of reading the value of <code>i</code>, adding <code>1</code> to it, or storing the result in <code>i</code></li>
<li>In the meantime, another thread can modify <code>i</code>, leading to incorrect results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Atomic operations finish executing without interruption. Atomic operations guarantee that a complete result will be computed and seen by all threads.</li>
<li>Synchronization primitives such as a mutex or a semaphore can be used to coordinate execution between threads</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org261fd08">Threads in Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org261fd08">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The most common python interpreter, CPython, implements a <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The GIL simplifies the creation of the interpreter while preserving good single-threaded performance</li>
<li>It also limits multi-threaded performance in python</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The GIL prevents multiple python instructions from executing simultaneously on a multi-core system.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thus, multi-threading with CPython is like multi-threading on a single-core CPU: the python code is not executed simultaneously</li>
<li>Operations on each thread are interleaved (that is, the python interpreter executes some commands on one thread, then switches to another).</li>
<li>The order of this interleaving is generally non-deterministic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The GIL does not prevent all race-conditions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You still need to synchronize threads that read/write to the same shared variables.</li>
<li>Bugs that occur due to specific orderings of operations on multiple threads can still occur</li>
<li>Non-atomic python statements can be interrupted before completion</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The GIL only applies to python bytecode instructions
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python code can call C code, and that C code can bypass the GIL</li>
<li>Python waits for a system function (e.g., to reading from a file), it is not executing bytecode.  Thus,
another thread can run while the other thread waits for the system.</li>
<li>Thus, multiple-threads can improve performance of input/output bound python programs but not
computationally bound ones.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>CPU bound means performance is limited by the available CPU resources</li>
<li>I/O bound means performance is limited by input/output operations (such as reading a file)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Atomic Operations: The following operations are guaranteed to complete once started, prior to another thread being run
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reading or writing a single variable of a basic type (int, float, string)</li>
<li>Assigning an object to a variable (e.g., x = y)</li>
<li>Reading an item from a list</li>
<li>Modifying an item in a list</li>
<li>Getting an item from a dictionary</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/library.html#what-kinds-of-global-value-mutation-are-thread-safe">A complete list of python atomic operations</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
If you perform a non-atomic operation, the thread you are running on can be interrupted in the middle.
Assume we have two threads, both performing  <code>i = i + 1</code>, a non-atomic operation.  Thus what is actually executed gets broken into several interruptable steps
</p>
<pre class="example">
i = 0
# Two threads are started
Thread 1            |        Thread 2
   i = i + 1        |           i = i + 1
</pre>

<p>
Operations can happen in multiple ways leading to different results: for example
</p>
<pre class="example">
Thread 1, reads i, it is 0
Thread 2, reads i, it is 0
Thread 1 adds 1 to what it read, yielding 1
Thread 1 stores 1 in i
Thread 1 reads i it is 1
Thread 1 adds 1 to what it read, yielding 2
Thread 2 adds 1 to what it read, yielding 1
Thread 1 stores 2 in i
Thread 2 stores 1 in i
</pre></li>

The threading model for rospy is poorly documented by ROS
The information here comes from my own explorations and discussion here <a href="https://answers.ros.org/question/9543/rospy-threading-model/">https://answers.ros.org/question/9543/rospy-threading-model/</a> (the whole series of answers).

<h3 id="org9e96b17">Timers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9e96b17">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>rospy.Timer(Rate(hz), callback)</code> lets you execute a callback at a given frequency.</li>
<li>Each timer runs in its own thread as soon as you create the timer.</li>
<li>While a timer callback is executing, it blocks that timer callback from running again.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, if you have a timer with period 1 second, but your code takes 3 seconds to execute,
The timer will effectively only trigger once every 3 seconds</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="orgfa950b9">Subscribers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfa950b9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In rospy, it seems that each topic you subscribe to gets one thread per publisher.</li>
<li>This means that a given subscriber callback can execute in different threads.</li>
<li>If you have multiple subscribers on the same topic in the same node, they execute on the same thread.</li>

<h3 id="orgc9d8f0f">What this threading model means for you</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc9d8f0f">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Be aware that the callbacks you write may operate in a separate threads</li>
<li>These threads are different from the main thread of your program</li>
<li>Synchronize between callbacks in the following order of complexity
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Only use local variables</li>
<li>Use atomic operations:
A very common use case is that you use a service to signal a change in a timer that is publishing data.  
If you set variables using atomic operations, which in python includes simple assignments, then you
should not run into issues or require explicit synchronization methods.
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html">Queue</a>, especially with a producer/consumer pattern.  Queues are thread-safe in python.  
One thread puts data onto the queue, the other thread reads it from the queue.</li>
<li>If you must, resort to the thread locking mechanisms provided by python</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>If you need tasks to happen concurrently, put them in different nodes.</li>

<h2 id="org5fe794d">roscpp and threads</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5fe794d">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The thread model for ROS is different in python and in C++</li>
<li>In roscpp, there is a single thread unless you explicitly create multiple threads</li>
<li>In C++ there is no GIL, thus threads can execute simultaneously on multi-core machines</li>
<li>In C++ the order in which expressions are executed is not necessarily the order in which they were coded;
therefore, you must be very careful when synchronizing threads</li>
