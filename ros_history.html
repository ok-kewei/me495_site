<h2 id="org9cb20cb">Introduction and History</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9cb20cb">
<p>
The <a href="https://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System</a> (ROS) is a collection of tools, software libraries, and documentation
facilitating the development and sharing of robotics software. The term "Operating System" is a bit of a misnomer,
 it is more like a framework or middleware plus a developer community. Its federated package model allows unrelated entities
to create and reuse compatible software.
</p>

<p>
Historically people and companies developed 
robotics software specifically tailored to their own robots and needs. 
For example, industrial robotics companies developed proprietary control software and programming languages
and there was no central location for robotics researchers to find useful software libraries. Over the years
there have been several attempts at creating libraries for robotics engineers to share, and ROS can be
seen as one of the more recent and popular of these attempts. For more information see <a href="https://www.ros.org/about-ros">About ROS</a>.
</p>

<p>
In 2007, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/Willow_Garage">Willow Garage</a> provided resources for researchers to create general-purpose robotics
software that could be reused and shared.  From the start, it was an effort involving a community of people at different institutions working on the core infrastructure and
various packages. In 2014, stewardship of ROS was transferred
to the <a href="https://www.openrobotics.org">Open Source Robotics Foundation</a> (now referred to as Open Robotics) a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
For more information, see <a href="https://www.ros.org/history">ROS History</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the intervening years, ROS has been adopted as a defacto standard in industry and academia.
While proprietary systems from many major robot manufactures still exist (and perhaps predominate),
there are now several robots on the market that explicitly support ROS (including the robots you will be using in this class).
Many start-up robotics companies also use ROS because it enables them to take advantage of the work of others to start with a baseline working system.
There are also initiatives such as <a href="https://rosindustrial.org">ROS Industrial</a>, which are bringing in more industrial robots into the fold of ROS.  In academia, ROS 
enables easy sharing of code between research groups and allows people to use the latest code from experts in the field.

<h2 id="org4e2f668">Why ROS?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org4e2f668">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>ROS has a large international community of users and contributors, so help is just a click or a forum-post away.</li>
<li>Provides a framework with infrastructure for visualizing, controlling, and simulating robots.</li>
<li>ROS has many packages, some of which include difficult-to-implement yet state-of-the-art algorithms.</li>
<li>Many robots provide ROS interfaces: learn ROS once, be able to use many robots.</li>
<li>ROS is Open Source.  No black-boxes: it is possible to understand and modify to fit your needs.</li>
<li>The ability to contribute back enables you to spread your discoveries and enhance your reputation in the field.</li>
<li>Many companies view ROS as an essential skill. Even for companies not using ROS, knowledge of ROS demonstrates familiarity with robotics in general.</li>

<h2 id="org60bd37d">The Future of ROS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org60bd37d">
<p>
ROS 2, the successor to ROS, began development in parallel.  Its first alpha release was in 2015, and it now has stable releases.
ROS 2 addresses many of the technical shortcomings in ROS 1 and is currently the primary focus of the core ROS developers.
Although ROS 2 is definitely an exciting development and the future of the community, ROS noetic will still be supported for 3 more years
and it takes time for transitions to happen, especially in robotics. 
Currently, ROS 1 remains more complete and commonly used then ROS 2; however, ROS noetic is the last planned release of ROS 1.
</p>

<p>
As for which to learn: the balance keeps tipping closer to ROS 2 each year, however, there remain obstacles that make it inappropriate
for a first course in robotic systems (in my opinion), especially in the context of getting academic-level robotic projects done on a tight time-frame.
Most importantly, our brand-new robots are not yet supported in ROS 2 (nor are most real robots that you can buy today)!

<h2 id="org089cf9a">Usage Statistics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org089cf9a">
<p>
In July 2020 (data taken from <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/Metrics">http://wiki.ros.org/Metrics</a>) there were 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2,026,515 Page views of the ROS wiki</li>
<li>795,114 views of answers. ROS.org</li>
<li>38,554,145 package downloads</li>
<li>Courses are taught at 33 universities around the world (<a href="http://wiki.ros.org/Courses">http://wiki.ros.org/Courses</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
As of July 2020, there were 7410 papers explicitly citing ROS. Note: July 2020 is the last time these particular statistics seem to have been summarized.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://metrics.ros.org">ROS metrics website</a> has the latest metrics.  
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The most widely used ROS 1 or ROS 2 distribution as of July 2021 is ROS melodic (the version prior to noetic), followed by noetic.</li>
<li>About 70% of ROS users are on ROS 1, as of July 2021.</li>
<li>ROS noetic has almost twice as many source-code repositories as ROS 2 foxy</li>
<li>ROS melodic has three times as many source-code repositories as ROS 2 foxy.</li>

<h2 id="org68a9526">ROS Versions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org68a9526">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ROS names each version with an adjective and the name of a turtle species, both starting with the same letter.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One thing I've learned from using ROS is that there are approximately 356 known species of turtle!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Versions are usually referred to by the adjective only</li>
<li>The versions increase alphabetically</li>
<li>The latest stable version of ROS is <code>noetic</code>, which was released in May 2020.</li>
<li><code>noetic</code> is the first version of ROS to support <code>python 3</code>, which is what we will use in this course.</li>
